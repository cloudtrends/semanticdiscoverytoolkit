## The Semantic Discovery Toolkit ##

These are general purpose tools and utilities developed (and developing) over time. Many of the tools have been developed and matured at and with the full support of [Semantic Discovery, Inc.](http://www.semanticdiscovery.com) who is a proud sponsor, contributor, and consumer of these tools. Many tools are also still experimental and under development.

The main purpose of this project is to promote the reuse of software tools and building blocks for the development of modular solutions to real world problems using techniques from artificial intelligence.

This is a repository for general domain agnostic utilities and frameworks upon which domain specific solutions can be built. Using the abstraction of an expert system as an analogy, this toolkit represents components of and for the inference engine but not the knowledge modules that it executes.

The utilities include the following types of implementations:

  * Wrapper classes and method implementations for simplifying common development tasks
  * Algorithm implementations
    * String searching and manipulation utilities
    * Artificial intelligence
      * Natural language processing
        * Information extraction and classification
        * Phrase parsing
      * Machine learning
      * Logical constructs
    * Light XML parsing and manipulation
    * Web crawling and extraction
    * Parallel distributed processing (cluster) framework
