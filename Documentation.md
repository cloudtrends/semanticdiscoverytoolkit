# Introduction #

The following (evolving) sources provide documentation for this project:

  * Continuous build artifacts
  * Code Javadocs
  * Test results
  * Notes files within the repository
  * Wiki pages

# Details #

## Continuous build artifacts ##

A daily build is performed complete with the generation of javadocs and test results, which can be found [here](http://www.semanticdiscovery.com/~spence/sdtoolkit/sd-docslink.html).

## Code Javadocs ##

Javadocs are generated by the ant build from the source (see [Building](http://code.google.com/p/semanticdiscoverytoolkit/wiki/Building)) using the target "javadoc" at the top level as well as for each module. The "javadoc" target is also invoked through the "all" target.

Once built, the javadocs are available at each module's _module_/build/doc/index.html

## Test results ##

Along with javadocs, the build also generates html-formatted unit test results through the "test" or "all" targets.

You will find the unit test reports at each module's _module_/build/reports/html/index.html

## Notes files ##

Scattered through the code base are "doc-files" directories with notes files within. Sometimes these files give insight into the ideas behind the design of particular components and include "todo" lists.

## Wiki pages ##

As the project progresses, it is intended to document each of the components through these wiki pages and place links to them here. Ultimately and ideally, linking high level problems, needs, and goals with the components available to solve them is desired.
